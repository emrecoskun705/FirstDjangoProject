This project is configured for:

1. Python version management with pyenv
2. Virtual environments with pipenv
3. Usage of environment variables
4. AWS S3 for static files

## Getting started

You will need to copy the `.settings.env` file and rename it `.env`. Inside there you can fill in the values of the environment variables, create a database and you're all good to go.
